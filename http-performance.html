      <h2>HTTP Performance</h2>

      <p>
        This page gives a beginner view of how newer versions of HTTP can help pages load faster
        or feel smoother. It’s not a deep dive, just the big ideas.
      </p>

      <h3>Quick comparison</h3>
      <table aria-label="HTTP versions comparison">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Version</th>
            <th>Very short idea</th>
            <th>What it means for pages</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>HTTP/1.1</td>
            <td>One file per connection (keep-alive helps).</td>
            <td>Many files can be slower due to waiting in line.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>HTTP/2</td>
            <td>Multiplexing: multiple files over one connection.</td>
            <td>Fewer waits; better use of one connection.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>HTTP/3</td>
            <td>Runs over QUIC (on UDP) instead of TCP.</td>
            <td>Can recover from packet loss faster; smoother on flaky networks.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        From a beginner view, HTTP/2 feels like getting multiple lanes on the same road
        (one connection, many files). HTTP/3 keeps that idea but handles traffic jams
        (packet loss) better, so pages feel less “stuck” on weak Wi-Fi.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Plain take:</strong> HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 try to keep your tab busy instead of stuck waiting.
        That usually means images, CSS, and scripts arrive more efficiently.

      <!-- HTTP/2 essentials (added for milestone 2)-->
<section id="http2">
  <h2>HTTP/2 at a Glance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Multiplexing:</strong> many streams share one TCP connection.</li>
    <li><strong>HPACK:</strong> header compression to cut overhead.</li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> better page loading for sites with many files than HTTP/1.1 pipelining.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- HTTP/3 essentials (added for milestone 2)-->
<section id="http3">
  <h2>HTTP/3 at a Glance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Runs over QUIC (UDP):</strong> built-in encryption & congestion control.</li>
    <li><strong>Lower latency helpers:</strong> 0-RTT resume, connection migration (Wi-Fi → LTE), no cross-stream head-of-line blocking.</li>
    <li><strong>QPACK:</strong> header compression designed to avoid stalls between streams.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- What changed recently (added for milestone 2)-->
<section id="changes">
  <h2>What Changed Lately</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> the newer, simpler <em>Priority</em> scheme replaces
        HTTP/2’s old “priority tree,” making it easier for browsers to tell servers which
        responses matter most.</li>
    <li><strong>Server Push:</strong> removed from Chrome due to mixed results; the platform moved toward <em>Preload</em> and <em>Early Hints</em> instead.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- Adoption snapshot (added for milestone 2) -->
<section id="adoption">
  <h2>Adoption Snapshot</h2>
  <p>
    HTTPS is now the default on most of the web, and HTTP/3 usage continues to rise across
    major CDNs and large sites.
